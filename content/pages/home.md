Title: Hello!
save_as: index.html

My name is Thomas Cole. Tom for short. I am a full-stack web developer and devops enthusiast. I enjoy writing software, and also writing about technology. I am currently [available for hire](contact/) for projects, contracts, as well as part-time and full-time employment.

In addition to web development, I have spent time doing technical support and training, as well as system and network administration. As a small-business IT consultant I've had to learn a little bit about a lot of different things over the years.

Currently I'm working with the [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) framework, which is written in Python. Flask makes use of the [Jinja2](https://palletsprojects.com/p/jinja/) templating language for rendering pages, or you can write REST-APIs which can be consumed by the JavaScript front-end of your choice, such as React.
