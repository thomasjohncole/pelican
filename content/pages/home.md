Title: Hello!
save_as: index.html

My name is Thomas Cole. Tom for short. I am a full-stack web developer, [DevOps](https://www.atlassian.com/devops) enthusiast, and information technology generalist. I enjoy writing software, and also writing about technology. I am currently [available for hire](contact/) for projects, contracts, as well as part-time and full-time employment.

In addition to web development, I have experience in system and network administration, as well as technical support, training, and documentation. As a small-business IT consultant I've had to learn a little bit about a lot of different things over the years.

Currently I'm working with the [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) micro-framework, which is written in [Python](https://www.python.org/). Flask makes use of the [Jinja2](https://palletsprojects.com/p/jinja/) templating language for rendering pages, or you can write REST-APIs which can be consumed by the front-end library of your choice, such as [React](https://reactjs.org/), which is written in [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript).

### About This Site

This website is made using [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/), a static-site generator also written in Python. Pelican also uses Jinja2 for templating. I am currently using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) for hosting.

Pelican employs the use of themes for layout and styling, similar to Wordpess. I am using a custom theme based on the free theme tuxlite_tbs, which uses the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) front-end component library. The main difference between my theme and the original is I have upgraded to Bootstrap 4, whereas the original tuxlite_tbs theme was built with Bootstrap version 3.
