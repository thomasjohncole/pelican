        <div><p><a href="http://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/">Deep Work, by Cal Newport</a>, has quickly become a productivity classic since its publication in 2016. It has greatly influenced me and the way I approach work and study, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to get the highest return from their time investments. Although many of the ideas in this book are not new, Cal does a great job of succinctly presenting the skills needed to thrive in today's knowledge economy.</p>
<p>Deep Work is defined by Cal as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here are my top five takeaways from Deep Work:</p>
<p><strong>1. Deep Work is probably harder than you think, and you probably don't do it as well as you think you do.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. If you can work deeply on a consistent basis, you will set yourself apart from the pack.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Attention switching is worse for you than you think.</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. Ritual and regularity are extremely helpful, and so is the occasional retreat.</strong></p>
<p><strong>5. You need downtime.</strong></p>
<h2>Deep Work is Harder Than You Think</h2>
<p>Deep work means intense concentration for large blocks of time. It doesn't mean looking at your phone every five minutes, or checking emails, or stopping your task every time you get bored, or tired, or think of something interesting to look up on Google.</p>
<p>Try this. Identify the most difficult thing you need to do today. Now turn off your phone, internet connection, etc., and go somewhere quiet where you can't be disturbed, and do just that thing and only that thing intensely, without stopping, for 30 minutes.</p>
<p>How did you do? If you found that more difficult that you thought, you're not alone. According to Cal, "The ability to concentrate intensely is a skill that must be trained." In the book he maintains even the best of us can only manage about four hours of Deep Work per day on a regular basis.</p>
<h2>Working Deeply is a Valueable Skill</h2>
<p>If you're able to work deeply on a regular basis, that probably means you can learn new things faster than your peers. You can get more done in less time, and you can take on more challenging tasks without becoming overwhelmed. This is valuable in today's marketplace.</p>
<p>If you're able to work deeply you can take on tasks that are less likely to be automated in the near future. Losing your job to some AI-based software is a real concern these days. Set yourself apart by training yourself to work deeply on a regular basis.</p>
<h2>Attention Switching is a Killer</h2>
<p>Every time you stop what you're doing you lose momentum. Don't multitask if you can help it. It's not productive. Obviously sometimes you have no choice, but setting aside a block of time to go deep on a solitary task should be a daily priority.</p>
<p>When you switch tasks often you are doing more damage than you think. According to Clifford Nass, a communications professor from Stanford University:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...People who multitask all the time can't filter out irrelevancy. They can't  manage a working memory. They are chronically distracted. They initiate much larger parts of their brain that are irrelevant to the task at hand ... they're pretty much mental wrecks.
<cite> - from a 2010 interview with NPR's Ira Flatow. (from page 158 of Deep Work)</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Same Place, Same Time, Every Day - or Maybe Just Disappear Completely for a While</h2>
<p>Having a special place and time to work deeply every day can create the kind of momentum needed to accomplish difficult things. The power of ritual, habit, and incremental effort are well recogized, and Cal points out several examples in the book of great achievers who took advantage of this idea. One example is the famous psychiatrist Carl Jung, who would retreat to his private office in St. Gallen every morning for two hours of uninterrupted writing time.</p>
<p>In the book Cal also refers to something called a "grand gesture" strategy. J.K. Rowling, while attempting to avoid all distractions while finishing her book <em>Deathly Hallows</em>, checked herself into the Balmoral Hotel in Edinborough, initially just for a change of mindset. Things went so well that she ended up finishing the book there. Obviously not all of us would find it practical to check into a five-star hotel just to get some work done, but a secluded nook in a coffee shop, or a stay-cation at your home desk for a week of intense work may serve a similar purpose.</p>
<h2>Don't Forget About Downtime</h2>
<p>The mind needs time to recover from deep work in order to combat fatigue, and also to help consolidate new ideas and concepts. Downtime can come in many forms, from a walk in the park, to enjoying a novel, or my personal favorite, staring at the ceiling. Seriously though, think of down time as truly restorate, not as just various forms of distraction, like aimless web surfing or social media feeding frenzies. Cal argues fairly convincingly in the book that the typical social media habit is not conducive to a lifestyle of working deeply, and should be rationed and scheduled responsibly. Another worthy mention is the idea of an Internet Sabbath - taking one day a week and completely disconnecting.</p>
<p>Another valuable idea regarding downtime, is what Cal refers to as the <em>shutdown ritual</em>. The point of the shutdown ritual is to create a concrete demarcation between your deep work time, and your downtime. This combats the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeigarnik_effect" title="Zeigarnik effect Wikipedia article">Zeigarnik effect</a>, which is the tendency for incomplete tasks to dominate your attention.</p>
<p>An effective shut down ritual could be as simple as taking 15 minutes at the end of the day to make a quick list of tasks for the next day, and then declaring out loud: "Shutdown complete." Experiment with it and come up with your own personal shutdown ritual. As Cal says "When you work, work hard. When you're done, be done."</p></div>
